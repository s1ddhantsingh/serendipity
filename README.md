# serendipity

### serendipity (n): _the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way_; serendipity is a blazingly fast command-line tool to optimize your day planning and schedule tracking.

## _the problem_

keeping track of my todos, websites, plans for a day etc. is a HASSLE. scheduled meetings are often missed, and very often this is because you simply forget. further, studies have shown that writing down all of your tasks helps you better accomplish them..

| day begins |
| --- |
| morning routine |
| open serendepity on CLI |
| add tasks, assign various factors as required by each task |
| automatagically update your JIRA board with specific tasks |


## _features_
1. want to change the role of a **TODO**? _as simple as moving it (mv) to a different task type_
2. want to delete a **TODO**? _as simple as deleting it (rm)_
3. want to view your entire **TODO** list in the terminal? _as simple as viewing it (ls)_
4. want to get an overall time cost of the **TODOs** that you predict? _as simple as asking for it (time?)_
5. want to update the timings of each **TODO**? (do you have meetings that you would like to add to apple calendar?) _as simple as marking the task (m) and updating the task's timings_
6. want to update this task to a figma jamboard to visually organize your tasks for the week? _as simple as marking the task (fj) and assigning variables_
7. want ChatGPT to give you recommendations on your **TODOs** (maybe break it up further into smaller assignments/**TODOs**?) _as simple as asking (ask)_
