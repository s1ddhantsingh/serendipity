# serendipity

## serendipity (n): the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way.

### serendipity is a blazingly fast command-line tool to optimize your day planning and schedule tracking.

### the problem

keeping track of my todos, websites, plans for a day etc. is a HASSLE. scheduled meetings are often missed, and very often this is because you simply forget. further, studies have shown that writing down all of your tasks helps you better accomplish them..
